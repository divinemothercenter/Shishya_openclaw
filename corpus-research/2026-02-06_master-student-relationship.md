## 1. The Master's Responsibility, The Student's Responsibility (PSYV4)

The master can do it up to a certain level in the student's life. Afterwards, he has no right to make the student's life anything. He only has a certain right, up to certain level, to make the student.

The nature of spirituality is sometimes that our soul walks like an elephant, sometimes it walks like a lion, sometimes it walks like a tiger, sometimes it walks like a horse. There are no limits to the speed of that. Each soul has their soul curve for connecting with God.

**The master's responsibility is, after he makes the car, fixes everything, then he's done, his duty's over. Brake, clutch, everything is there, perfect. He taught you how to drive. Then he makes the student to drive on the ground in the open.**

How much speed can he go? There aren't any holes. There's no more place to have an accident. It's a big open ground. Like the sky, it's open. He can travel anywhere. The master's says, "Hey, where you're going? Why are you wasting your energy, go this way, come that way, again this way?" He's telling you to go straightly.

First of all, the master's duty is to get everybody in the car, and after teaching you how to drive, "Come on. Carry on." Somebody will drive like this, like that. In meditation, I'm telling you it is the same, exactly like driving a car.

## 2. The Immortal Bond (PSYV4)

THE MASTER, YOU & THE PROCESS  
CHAPTER 26 GURU PARAMPARA

The master and student relationship is beyond any relationship on this planet. That bond, that relationship, is immortal. It's forever and ever for many lifetimes. You really need to carry that relationship with Guru Parampara. Whatever it is, it is. Even if the guru is giving a little hard time to you sometimes, again he knows how to give you the real fragrance to make you really like fivical. You know fivical? Super glue. He knows how to make you really stick, to make the bond.

A master is a master who is waking up the knowledge in you, who is telling the truthful knowledge and making a light in your darkness. He's the real master. You have to open your heart completely and surrender to follow him.

The relationship between the master and the student is an amazing bond. Nobody can separate it. The master always tries to shake you. **The master is like a monkey. To be honest, absolutely he's a learned and skilled monkey. You're a natural monkey; he's a learned, skilled monkey. You're a baby to him. Do you ever see a mother monkey running and jumping with its baby? It never, ever cares if the baby is there or not. The baby's security is just holding onto the mother very strongly.**

Your master is your sweet helping man at the same time helpful confusing master. To be honest, it is good for you. It's really good for you for when the nature is really shaking you. Before, I am shaking you. Then I am sending you. Then you can stand there. Any master in the universe with their master did it the 100% same way accurately. The went through the same door. Period.

## 3. Creating Masters Is a Huge Job (PSYV4)

Nowadays, if the master is really shaking, filtering, how many people can stay for that? Not many. They want to run away. They think the master is a little crazy, a little off, a little dark, negative. They feel they are right and the master is a little funny. Then they run away. Then the master feels, "Thank you God." He takes a little fan and makes some air. The master doesn't need the student, one part. If he really wants to transfer something to somebody, he can ask Mother Divine at the time, "Hey, bring one student to give this." If Mother Divine doesn't bring anyone, they give up.

For example, Baba, in his lifetime, never made masters. With his soul, now he's doing it. Just see me, he caught me. I'm completely trapped. I'm in his cage. I feel sometimes I really want to get out. Sometimes I feel, "Okay, let me get out." Then I feel the big iron bars again. I'm running like 1,000 kilometers' speed. He's running 5,000 kilometers speed ahead. "I'm here. Where are you going?" Again he releases me, "Okay go, go." Then he takes a thread, zzzsssttt, pulls me back.

One part I feel so happy. One part I feel, "Oh what is my karma to take on a lot of illusions?" Why not just be a devotional master to teach the simple devotional things. It's such a different story. **To prepare illusion masters, Mahamaya masters, that's a huge job. Making one master is equal to taking care of one hundred million people––easily, one hundred million people.**

If everybody comes in a normal devotional process giving shaktipat and blessings, receiving shaktipat and blessings, singing bhajans, going back your country and sitting as a normal peaceful person, it is not a problem at all. It is not at all a big deal. But, **to really become a master, to really become part of a creator in the universe, to become hugely responsible for the real karma, the people's karmas, to purify their karmas, wash their karmas, give amazing things in their lives to know themselves, it's big work.**

## 4. Karma Balances Between Master and Student Automatically (PSYV2)

We have to be clear to karma yoga. **Karma balances between master and student automatically even without either's desire, intention or wish, even without their notice.** Note this point. Make that point. It makes huge help in your Sri Chakra understanding. Automatically how the karma that in the very deeper stages.

When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was dying, in his last stages he suffered with many diseases, especially with cancer. He suffered horribly, cancer in his back and his throat, throughout his body. Many people asked him, "Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, you did the great miracles in your life. If anybody came with a cobra bite, you gave a healing. You gave spiritual healings, woke up everybody's soul, then everybody's lives were going very good. You did many things. You have the direct communication to Mother Kali. Why are you not healing yourself?"

At the time, he answered, "It's the karma."

**If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa blessed a person, anyone, that person's energy's played on him. That person's energy came to him, making the karma balance. Making the balance. Without the student's soul doing, without the master's soul doing, it works automatically, balancing there.**

When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was dying, he told his students that it was karma from the thousands of people he's spoke with that he had blessed. The master can make the student cross the entire ocean of spirituality to attain God at one time and in one leap.

## 5. The Master is Responsible for What He's Giving You (PSYV4)

What is the main intention the master is making someone wait? Your soul and mind has to be mature. if he gives some abilities to your soul but your mind is not mature, it's so crazy, then you can do a lot of bad works. Then you can receive a lot of negativity to your soul. **Then that master who gave the channel to you is responsible for that negativity. Then that negative energy will come like millions of times bigger to him. Then he has to purify that very badly. That's why all the masters in the universe are really scared with the mental condition of their students.**

Even if he has a really nearest, dearest friend as a student and they're living together for 20 years, sleeping on one cot and eating from one plate. But on the soul point, if the master cannot trust the student's mind, he will never release it. he'll wait.

You have to bring up your mind's determination to stand by yourself. once you can create the strong impression in your heart you can take the strong determination in your mind. Then with such strong determination thoughts, automatically it develops in you to stand there like a big pillar.

**The master has those exact same feelings, doubts on the students because he's the one responsible for the karma. You have to create a lot of secure feelings in his heart. That's my point.**

## 6. Vivekananda & Ramakrishna (PSYV2)

Just take one example. Vivekananda was a very crazy boy. Really, he was a very crazy boy from the beginning. He went to everybody, to all the supernatural saints, "Hey, you are a saint? You have seen God any time? Have you seen God?"

He interviewed some thousands of the saints like that, in thousands of the maths in India. Somebody suggested to him, "Go and meet Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He's the only right master to you, to solve your problem."

Then he found Ramakrishna Paramahamsa sitting in front of the river, in the deep silence. **Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had been waiting for Vivekananda for many years, for his real student. Waiting.**

Vivekananda was asking crazy questions: "Blah blah blah blah blah. You have any time seen God? Have you talked any time with God? Can you tell some experiences with God?"

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, "Oh, my dear boy, I have never seen God. I'm just fighting. Still I'm fighting some many years. But I'm failing. But I can give a small formula to show you how to see God."

Vivekananda said, "Hey, you haven't seen God! Why are you giving a formula to me? Are you a fool? I'm not your fool! You'll waste my time. Goodbye, I want to go."

Ramakrishna Paramahamsa simply said, "Hey please, just follow this advice. Give me 41 days time. Wherever you go, it will be no use. Just give me 41 days time."

So Vivekananda said, "Okay, I'll follow you for 41 days."

Then Ramakrishna Paramahamsa gave one formula to Vivekananda. "Just every day, do this meditation. Then after 41 days, you come to me."

After 40 days were over, Vivekananda became very crazy about Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He went very badly crazy, "I wasted 40 days. Nothing's happened. That old man gave me very big trouble. What did he say? Definitely I'm going to kill him! I'm going to bite him! I'm going to nag him!"

**On the 41st day, he did his meditation, then he slept. In his dreams, Adi Parashakti came. Shakti. Adi Parashakti showing Her tongue, with all the skulls. Kali with Her trisula. Vivekananda had a great dream with Her.** He became afraid, horribly afraid. Then he woke up, "Oh, my God. What happened to me?" If he closed his eyes, if he opened his eyes, that structure was there, laughing. He was hearing Her voice.

In the early morning, he ran to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, to surrender to his feet. "What's going on in my life? Have you done any black magic on me? Please, take all that energy! It's too much for me."

Then Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, "No, no, you go in the temple. Kali is there. Go and surrender to Her, not me. I'm not the person. There is a lot of work you have to do in the world, to spread the love seeds."

## 7. The Bond Between Master and Student Is Immortal (SSBUM)

The master and student relationship is beyond any relationship on this planet. That bond, that relationship, is immortal. It's forever and ever for many lifetimes. You really need to carry that relationship with the Guru Parampara. Whatever it is, it is. Even if the guru is giving a little hard time to you sometimes, again he knows how to give you the real fragrance and make you stick like super glue. He knows how to make you really stick, to make the bond.

**A guru and shishya, a master and the student, is like flower and fragrance, but you have to see who is the flower and who is the fragrance. When you figure out where the fragrance is coming from, done.**

Wherever you go, he is there. Having a sadguru, you allow him to do whatever he wants to do in your life. But you have to allow it: "He's my best well-wisher. He is everything in my life. Let him do whatever he wants to do."

**To understand a master, to handle a master, is very difficult.** Nowadays the monkey mind is crazy with jealousy, skepticism, doubt, and all question marks. Once you give your heart, and once you see your relationship with him, then you can see him with real clarity.
