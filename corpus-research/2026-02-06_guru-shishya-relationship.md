## 1. The Bond Between the Master and Student Is Immortal (SSBUM)

The master and student relationship is beyond any relationship on this planet. That bond, that relationship, is immortal. It's forever and ever for many lifetimes. You really need to carry that relation- ship with the Guru Parampara. Whatever it is, it is. Even if the guru is giving a little hard time to you sometimes, again he knows how to give the real fragrance and make you stick like super glue. He knows how to make you really stick, to make the bond.

A master is a master who is awakening the knowledge in you, who is telling the truthful knowledge and making a light in your darkness. He's the real master. You have to open your heart completely and surrender to follow him.

**A guru and shishya, a master and the student, is like flower and fragrance, but you have to see who is the flower and who is the fragrance. When you figure out where the fragrance is coming from, done.**

The relationship between the master and the student is an amazing bond. Nobody can separate it. But the master always tries to shake you. The master is like a monkey. To be honest, absolutely he's a learned and skilled monkey. You're a natural monkey; he's a learned, skilled monkey. You're a baby to him. Did you ever see a mother monkey running and jumping with its baby? It doesn't care if the monkey baby is holding on. The baby's security is just holding onto the mother very strongly.

Your master is your sweet helping man at the same time helpful confusing master. To be honest, it is good for you. It's really good training for you to prepare for when the nature is really shaking you. First, I am shaking you, then I am sending you, then you can stand. Any master in the universe did it exactly the same way with his master. They went through the same door. Period.

Wherever you go, he is there. Having a sadguru, you allow him to do whatever he wants to do in your life. But you have to allow it: "He's my best well-wisher. He is everything in my life. Let him do whatever he wants to do."

## 2. Baba's Dedication to His Master (SSBUM)

You need to be prepared to reach the master's heart. That's very important. To me, to reach Baba's heart took a lot of time. It took a lot of time. He drives me – sorry to say – he drives me crazy. Oooo! Many times I bow my head, "What did I do to you? What did I do? I can't do all this. Give me thirty minutes time to take a nap."

He says, "No, keep go. Keep go." And he confuses, confuses. I thought the work was done, it was ready to happen, I was almost all there, I did all the effort, I did all the work, then he switches all the way to another direction, then another direction. Then I don't know which direction I'm going until finally he says, "You're going this direction."

"Thanks, fine, I'm happy."

That is the master's leela. To reach the master's heart is an art. It's surrender, patience, pure and pure love. Do or die. You need to get that.

**Shirdi Baba's master, Venkusa, gave a brick to him and said, "Use this brick as a pillow your entire life. Go and stay in Shirdi." He suffered horribly. But it was his master's order.**

"Why are you torturing?" Baba asked Venkusa. But even though Baba was an avatar, even though he had unbelievable abilities, he still followed his master's order.

Baba's history tells of the dedication to follow his master. That dedication made him prove bhakti and shakti. Already in another lifetime Baba had buried his austerities power in his gurusthan in Shirdi. Baba didn't have the clarity on that, but he knew some connection was there, otherwise the master wouldn't say go there.

**The point here, a commitment between you and the master is required. Otherwise no chance, absolutely no chance to win the Mother, put it that way. Once you have the commitment, seal it, like a real marriage, a real friendship, a real attachment, then you can take off. For Baba to sleep on the brick for his entire life is not a joke. It's a commitment. That commitment means bandham, a bond. It's the most powerful relationship on the planet – master and student. That's immortal.**

You really need to carry that relationship with guru Parampara. Whatever it is, it is. Even if the guru is giving a little hard time to you sometimes, again he knows how to give you the real fragrance to make you really like fivical. You know fivical? super glue. he knows how to make you really stick, to make the bond.

## 4. The Tortoise Glance - Baba Teaching Radhabai (SSS - Sai Satcharitra)

From Shirdi Sai Satcharitra, Baba speaking to Radhabai:

"I had a guru. He was a great saint and most merciful. I served him long, very long; still he would not blow any mantra into my ears...His two coins were **(1) firm faith and (2) patience or cheerful endurance.**"

"**Nishtha (faith) and saburi (patience) are like twin sisters, loving each other very intimately.**"

"My guru never taught me any mantra...Just remember that **the guru's tortoise-like loving glance gives us happiness**...Make me the sole focus of your thoughts and actions and you will, no doubt, attain Paramatma."

"**Just as the tortoise feeds her young ones by her loving looks, whether they are near her or away from her on the other side of the riverbank...The tortoise's glance is a downpour of nectar to her young ones, the only source of sustenance and happiness. Similar is the relationship between the guru and disciple.**"
