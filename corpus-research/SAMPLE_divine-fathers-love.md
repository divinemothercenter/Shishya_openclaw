# The Divine Father's Love: Entering the Open-Hearted Embrace of Shiva

**SUBTITLE:** The Divine Father's love is not earned by perfection, but with open hearts

---

## The Father We're Looking For

Every human heart carries some memory or longing for a father. For some, it is tender and safe. For others, it is complicated. But beneath all experience is a deeper archetype: the Father who protects without fear, forgives without condition, and receives the soul without judgment.

In Sri Kaleshwar's teachings, that archetype is Shiva—the Divine Father.

We often imagine the Divine as a cosmic judge, or as an idealized parent we can never please. Yet Kaleshwar describes Shiva as the most open-hearted character in Creation, whose love is not transactional but unconditional.[1] Shiva is Bhola Shankara—the innocent Father who gives blessings without judgment when the soul has made sincere effort.[1]

That means the Father's love is not earned by perfection. It is accessed by honesty, devotion, and the willingness to turn inward.

Shiva does not keep a ledger. He wants his children to come home—not with flawless performance, but with open hearts.

The Father's love is not a metaphor. It is a real energy you can feel, invoke, and live within.

The rest of this article is a path into that love.

## Shiva: The Father as Deep Silence

Kaleshwar does not first define Shiva as a person. He defines Shiva as deep silence, the source of everything.

"From the beginning, the energy came from Shiva. He's beyond all. Shiva is the deep silence, the source of everything. That silence equals God."[2]

This matters because it reframes fatherhood. The Father is not just a personality above us; he is the stillness within us.

The Father's love is not only a protection outside the soul—it is the ground of being inside it.

When you touch stillness—during meditation, prayer, nature, or even a moment between thoughts—you touch Shiva. That stillness is the Father. It is the safe foundation that holds you even when everything else collapses.

## The Father as Infinite Sky

Sri Kaleshwar offers another image: the sky.

"The sky is a huge unbounded energy. Sky is Shiva, Shiva is sky. He completely covers this galaxy and all the galaxies beyond with huge cosmic energy. It has no limit."[3]

This is the Father's love as infinite space. It cannot be exhausted, argued with, or controlled. It simply contains all things.

And here is the grace: you do not need all of it. Kaleshwar says even one percent of Shiva's energy is enough to live happily.[3]

That means the Father's love is not scarce. You do not have to deserve the whole ocean. One drop is enough to change your life.

## The Open-Hearted Father

Kaleshwar's most explicit description of Shiva as Father is simple and profound:

"Shiva's the number one pure, open-hearted character in Creation. The Father is that, purely forgiving, 100% forgiving. Purely not judging the way we judge ourselves."[1]

This statement alone dismantles so many inner narratives. The Father is not like the voice in your mind that keeps score of your failures. The Father does not weaponize your past. The Father does not hold grudges.

If your inner world is shaped by shame or performance, this teaching is medicine. The Father is forgiveness itself.

Shiva is called Bhola Shankara—the "innocent one" or "simple one." When a seeker has done their duty and earned that moment with Shiva, he gives without judgment.[1]

That means the Father's love is available when we show up. It is not blocked by our mistakes.

## The Father Who Receives the Soul

Perhaps the most radical dimension of Shiva's fatherhood is revealed in his cosmic role.

Shiva is the receiver of souls at death. Kaleshwar describes the cycle: when a soul dies, Mother Divine first receives it in her lap to relax it. Then she sends it to the Father, which is Shiva.[4]

This means that when the soul is at its most fragile—between worlds—Shiva receives it. The Father's love is not abstract; it is the cosmic function of holding the soul at the most vulnerable threshold.

Kaleshwar expands this role: Shiva created powerful beings to receive souls and transfer them back to him, like sub-banks transferring to the head bank.[5] Shiva is the main creator in charge of receiving souls back.[5]

This is fatherhood at the highest level: the one who receives you when everything else falls away.

## The Father Who Absorbs Our Pain

A true father does not only comfort his children. He takes their pain upon himself.

Kaleshwar says:

"Shiva can suck the poison means he can suck any soul depression, pain, your sufferings, your negative karmas... He is called: Bhola Shankara—he is the number one person to giving the blessings."[6]

Shiva is Nilakanta, the blue-throated one who drank poison to save creation. That is the Father's love: absorbing what would destroy us, holding it in his own throat so it cannot destroy his children.

In human terms, this is the father who refuses to abandon the child in distress. The father who stays in the room with grief. The father who looks at your pain and says, "I can carry this."

## The Father as a Force of Peace

Kaleshwar describes the effect of Shiva's energy on the soul:

"Once you receive Shiva's energy, you're very quiet, a man of peace... You're in bliss all the time. It's beyond the enlightenment."[7]

The Father's love is not only emotional comfort. It is a state of being. It quiets the mind and creates deep peace.

If your nervous system is restless or your heart unsettled, this teaching says: the Father's love is a real energy that can shift your inner state. It is not merely a belief; it is a transmission.

## Why We Struggle to Receive the Father's Love

If the Father is so open-hearted, why do we still feel distant?

Kaleshwar says Mother Divine is always working to create the world's illusions, and it is Shiva who breaks those illusions. The Shiva energy protects us from negative forces and dissolves the mind's stories.[11]

In other words, the barrier is not the Father—it is our illusions. The Father is always open. We are the ones who are closed.

This is why energy times like Shivaratri are so important. Kaleshwar says Shivaratri is the most powerful and open time for human beings to merge with the Divine Father's energy.[12] It is a time when the Mother is preoccupied with Shiva, and illusions weaken. Souls can unite with Shiva more easily.[13]

So there are moments in the year when the Father's love is more accessible—not because the Father moves closer, but because the veil is thinner.

## The Father's Love as a Spiritual Practice

Shiva's love is not just something to believe. It is something to practice.

**1) The Sky Mantra**

Kaleshwar calls the Sky Mantra one of the highest Shiva prayers:

"'Shivena saha mogate' means your soul is completely surrendering to Shiva: 'Oh, my dear Lord Shiva, You're the only big boss to take care of my soul.' … If you chant this mantra, you will have the strongest willpower."[8]

This is not just a mantra for devotion. It is a declaration: the Father is the one who takes care of my soul. It is surrender to the Father's protection.

**2) Abishek: Washing the Soul**

Kaleshwar says when you do abishek to the Shiva Lingam, you are not washing Shiva. You are washing your own soul:

"When you are doing abishek to the Shiva Lingam, you are not putting water on Him — you are putting it on your soul to wash it."[9]

A father washes the child, cleanses them after difficulty. Abishek is the Father washing the soul.

**3) Om Namah Shivaya**

Even a simple repetition of Shiva's name has power:

"The vibration of Namashivaya will wash soul karmas and soul blocks... It will definitely wash them, no matter what."[10]

The Father's love is in the vibration. It does not require complex knowledge. It requires devotion.

## The Father's Love Is Not Weakness

Some mistake forgiveness for weakness. Yet Shiva's love is not passive.

He is the cosmic force that breaks illusion and protects against negativity.[11] He is the one who gives Brahma Consciousness and carries the highest authority in the universe.[5]

This means the Father's love is not permissive. It is powerful, fierce in protection, and strong in guidance.

A true father does not just soothe; he also protects and disciplines. Shiva's silence is not passivity. It is the stillness of absolute power.

## A Personal Path into the Father's Embrace

So how do you actually receive this love?

**Step 1: Become Still**  
The Father's love is found in silence. Sit in meditation and feel the stillness within. That is Shiva.

**Step 2: Speak Honestly**  
The Father forgives completely. Bring your shame, your fear, your anger. Let the Father hold it.

**Step 3: Invoke the Mantra**  
The Sky Mantra or Om Namashivaya is a direct call to the Father. Chant it aloud or inwardly.

**Step 4: Offer the Pain**  
If the Father drinks poison, then offer your poison. Name your sorrow and give it.

**Step 5: Rest in Peace**  
As Shiva's energy comes in, allow yourself to rest. Let the Father's love soften the nervous system. Let it quiet the mind.

## The Father You've Always Sought

At the deepest level, we are all seeking a love that is not conditional, a presence that is not judging, a home that is not fragile.

That is the Father.

Sri Kaleshwar's teachings show us that Shiva is not only a mythic figure. He is the living energy of forgiveness, silence, protection, and peace. He is the Father who receives us in death, the one who absorbs our pain in life, the one who waits for our return with an open heart.

To turn toward Shiva is to discover that the Father's love has never been withheld.

The Father is already here, in the silence beneath your mind, in the sky above your head, in the breath inside your chest.

You are not too broken for this love. You are not too late.

The Father is waiting.

And his arms are open.
