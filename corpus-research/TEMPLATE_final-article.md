## Key Differences from Raw Research

| Raw Research | Final Article |
|--------------|---------------|
| Passages in order retrieved | Synthesized narrative |
| Multiple redundant quotes | One clear thread |
| Scholar tone | Personal tone |
| "Here's what was found" | "Here's what this means for you" |
| List format | Story format |

## Sample Opening Patterns

**Pattern 1: Universal longing**
> "Every human heart carries some memory or longing for..."

**Pattern 2: The question we're asking**
> "We often wonder if... The teaching answers..."

**Pattern 3: Personal admission**
> "I used to believe... Until I discovered..."
