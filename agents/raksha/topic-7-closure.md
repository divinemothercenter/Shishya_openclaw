## Context Note: Kriti

Kriti went from being the sharpest to the dullest memory and initiative over past 24 hours.

**Root cause:** Lost API auth; that ran for a while and injected noise into her system.

**Recovery plan:** She needs to decharge and she'll be fine.

**Lesson:** API auth failures can degrade agent performance through accumulated noise. Monitor auth status and restart/discharge when degradation appears.
