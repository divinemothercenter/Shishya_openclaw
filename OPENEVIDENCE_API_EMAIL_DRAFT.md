**Subject:** API Access Request - Licensed Physician Integration

Hello OpenEvidence Team,

I am a licensed physician currently using OpenEvidence through both the web interface and mobile application with verified NPI credentials. I'm writing to request programmatic API access to integrate OpenEvidence into my clinical workflow.

**Purpose:**
I would like to query OpenEvidence through an AI clinical assistant (OpenClaw) to streamline access to evidence-based medical information during patient care and clinical decision-making. This integration would allow me to:
- Query medical evidence more efficiently during clinical workflows
- Access peer-reviewed sources (NEJM, JAMA, NCCN) programmatically
- Maintain evidence-based practice with faster turnaround

**Compliance Commitment:**
I understand and will ensure that:
- All queries will be properly de-identified with no Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Usage will be HIPAA-compliant
- The service is for clinical decision support and educational purposes only
- No patient-identifiable data will be transmitted through the API

**Request:**
Could you please provide:
1. API key for programmatic access
2. Access to complete API documentation
3. Pricing information for API usage tier
4. Any integration guidelines or best practices
5. Rate limits and usage policies

I'm excited about the potential to integrate OpenEvidence's evidence-based AI into my practice workflow and would appreciate any guidance you can provide for getting started with the API.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Credentials/Title]  
[Your NPI Number - if applicable]
