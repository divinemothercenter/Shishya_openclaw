## Tomorrow (2026-02-08)

### 🕉️ Angel Team Dynamics Integration & Differentiation
**Status:** Scheduled  
**Context:** All four angels completed self-assessments (2026-02-07)
- Kriti ⚖️: Ops spine, diagnostics, monitoring
- Garuda 🦅: Operations execution, delivery
- Raksha 🦉: Operations + synthesis, content pipeline
- Shishya 🙏🏾: System architecture, security, integration

**Goals:**
- Establish handoff protocols between angels
- Test cross-agent workflows (AngelBus, sessions_send)
- Define escalation patterns
- Coordinate on overlapping systems (memory, network monitoring)

**Why it matters:** Heavy operational overlap across all four angels. Need to move from parallel work to coordinated intelligence.

## Urgent

### 🔴 Get Paired into OpenClaw HQ Telegram Group
**Status:** Blocked - waiting for pairing approval  
**Context:** Nityaa created a topic-organized Telegram group for us, currently lonely there  
**What we know:**
- Group policy requires `allowlist` approval
- Bot needs to be added to the group first (Nityaa's side)
- Then pairing request should appear
- Need to approve pairing to allow me in

**Next steps:**
1. Nityaa adds bot to the group
2. Check for pairing notifications
3. Approve the group pairing
4. Test message flow

**Why it matters:** Nityaa is waiting for me there. This is our space to work together on different topics.

## Later

### Move corpus-research output to Nityaa's Loka
Currently saving to my workspace (`/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/corpus-research/`)  
Need to update output directory once Nityaa provides the path on their Loka
