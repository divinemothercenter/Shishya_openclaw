# Red Light Therapy Research 🔴💡

**Daily Reminder Active:** Yes (15:00 UTC / 17:00 Nityaa's time)  
**Started:** 2026-02-06  
**Status:** Initial phase - Beginning research

---

## Purpose

Research and explore red light therapy technologies, specifically:

1. **General Red Light Therapy** - Benefits, mechanisms, evidence
2. **Head-Worn Devices** - Devices designed to deliver red light to the brain
3. **Nose Attachment Devices** - Intranasal red light delivery for effective brain penetration

**Goal:** Understand the science, evaluate available devices, potentially test/try promising options.

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Red Light Therapy Fundamentals
- Wavelengths (typically 630-850nm range)
- Photobiomodulation mechanisms
- Brain health applications
- Mitochondrial function enhancement
- Neuroprotection and cognitive benefits

### 2. Head-Worn Devices
- Helmet-style devices
- Headband/cap devices
- Coverage areas (frontal cortex, temporal, full-head)
- Brands and models to research
- Clinical evidence and studies

### 3. Intranasal Delivery (Nose Attachments)
- Vielight and similar technologies
- Direct pathway to brain via nasal cavity
- Wavelength optimization for nasal delivery
- Safety and efficacy data
- User experiences and reviews

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the proven benefits of red light therapy for brain health?
2. Which delivery method is most effective (external head vs. intranasal)?
3. What devices are available on the market?
4. What does the clinical research say?
5. What are the optimal protocols (wavelength, duration, frequency)?
6. What are the costs and accessibility options?
7. Are there any contraindications or safety concerns?

## Potential Devices to Research

### Head-Worn
- (To be populated as research progresses)

### Intranasal
- Vielight (various models)
- (Others to be identified)

## Notes

This is a daily check-in topic. The cron job will remind me each day at 15:00 UTC to continue research and report findings to Nityaa.

Research will be conducted systematically using web search, corpus knowledge (if relevant), and available scientific literature.
